<!--Our topic title is Talking about Gaza  -->
<h1>GAZA</h1>
<!-- Here it contains what happened in the Gaza Strip -->
<p>How did the October 7 War, or the Al-Aqsa Flood, begin in 2023?</p>
<P>the war began when militants invaded Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023. An Israeli counterattack took place. Israel officially declared war on Hamas on October 8. This event is part of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially the conflict between Gaza and Israel</P>
 <p>A lot of destruction occurred, including neighborhoods, schools, mosques, and hospitals, and it resulted in many casualties, including children, women, animals, and the disabled, meaning many martyrs.</p>
 <p>Among the hospitals that were bombed:</p>
 <P>Indonesian Hospital,
    Al-Ahly Hospital,
    International Eye Centre</P>
    <p>This also resulted in the displacement of many Gazans, going to southern Gaza and seeking refuge in schools.</p>
